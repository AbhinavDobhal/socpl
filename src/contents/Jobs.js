            <p>
              We follow a unique methodology for the selection of the candidates
              which includes their proper screening on the basis of aptitude and
              skill. We keep the specific requisites of the clients in mind
              before selecting the candidates. We implement sourcing, screening,
              reporting and performance methodologies for your entire
              organization while the existing HR team handles the interviewing,
              hiring and on boarding processes.
